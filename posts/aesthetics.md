The Fabulous Journey draws its aesthetics from several sources. Firstly, the different worlds depicted in Cartier's EOY campaign serve as inspiration for the game's future levels. The idea of floating boxes, which will also be featured in the game, can also be seen in these visuals. The dreamlike and whimsical nature of these visuals served as a moodboard and greatly captivated and motivated our team.
